I need to translate this Portuguese request into English and format it as a concise list of issues and improvements, focusing on technical problems and UX enhancements.

The key points from the request are:
- The redirection problem after login persists (no redirection)
- Generated images don't match the stories (should always be cartoon-style, never realistic)
- Not all characters have images (drawings)
- Remove the text highlighting functionality
- Add functionality to store generated stories and track reading progress
- Improve the site's visual design and navigation
- Make the site more attractive to children

I'll organize these into a concise, bullet-point format in English.
