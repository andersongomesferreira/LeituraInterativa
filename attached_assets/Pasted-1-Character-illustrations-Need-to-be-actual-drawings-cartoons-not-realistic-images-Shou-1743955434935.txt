1. Character illustrations:
   - Need to be actual drawings/cartoons, not realistic images
   - Should be fun/playful in style
   - Emphasizing these should be drawings, not photographs or realistic renderings

2. Chapter illustrations:
   - Each chapter of a story should have a corresponding illustration
   - These illustrations should represent the content of that specific chapter
   - Again, these should be in a drawing/cartoon style

This is a request about the visual design direction for the story generation platform, specifically focusing on the illustration style and implementation. The user wants a more cartoon-like, child-friendly illustration approach throughout the platform.

I'll create a concise technical specification focusing on these illustration requirements in English.
