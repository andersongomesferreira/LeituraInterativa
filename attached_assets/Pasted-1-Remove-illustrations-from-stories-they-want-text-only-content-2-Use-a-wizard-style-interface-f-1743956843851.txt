1. Remove illustrations from stories - they want text-only content
2. Use a wizard-style interface for story creation and presentation
3. Each chapter should be presented in a wizard step format
4. The story creation process should follow a wizard flow with steps for:
   - Selecting age
   - Selecting character
   - Selecting theme
   - Final story generation
5. Recreate all characters
6. Add functionality for children to create custom/personalized characters
7. The custom character should function as a personal mascot

I'll create a concise, bullet-pointed specification for these changes in English.
