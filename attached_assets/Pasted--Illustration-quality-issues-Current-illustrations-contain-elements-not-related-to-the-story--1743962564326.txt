. Illustration quality issues:
   - Current illustrations contain elements not related to the story
   - Need simpler illustrations but must include all chapter characteristics

2. Illustration generation process:
   - Generate illustrations in the background automatically
   - No need for the child to click to generate them
   - Show a loading bar while the child reads the first chapter
   - Make this process feel natural

3. Cost optimization:
   - Use GPT-3.5 or cheaper alternatives for text generation
   - For images, automatically validate and use the cheapest available option at the time

Let me structure a response that addresses these requirements clearly and concisely, focusing on technical implementation and user experience considerations.

# LeiturinhaBot - Illustration & Cost Optimization Update

## Illustration Refinement
- Simplify illustrations to focus only on relevant story elements
- Ensure all key chapter characteristics are included in each drawing
- Remove extraneous visual elements not mentioned in the story text
- Implement content validation to verify illustration-story alignment

## Background Generation Process
- Automatically generate all chapter illustrations in background threads
- Implement progressive loading while child reads first chapter
- Display subtle loading bar indicator showing illustration progress
- Pre-cache next chapter illustrations during reading time
- Create seamless visual transition between text and appearing illustrations

## Cost Optimization Implementation
- **Text Generation**:
  - Default to OpenAI GPT-3.5 for all story generation
  - Implement alternative providers (Mistral, Llama) as backup options
  - Create real-time cost comparison service to select cheapest provider
  - Cache common story patterns to reduce API calls

- **Image Generation**:
  - Implement dynamic provider selection based on current pricing
  - Automated cost-checking before each illustration request
  - Prioritize order: Self-hosted SD → Canva → DALL-E → Others
  - Daily rate checking to respond to pricing changes
  - Implement simple style templates to reduce token usage

## Technical Implementation
- Create background worker service for non-blocking illustration generation
- Implement WebSocket for real-time progress updates
- Develop provider cost API to check current rates across services
- Add illustration quality validation to ensure minimum standards
- Create adaptive loading animation based on estimated generation time
